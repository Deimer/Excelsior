# Android Challenge #excelsior

The challenge is to develop a mini software project to assess your strength and technique, and of course,
your development process.

We don’t want you to complete the app, nor do we want you to have 100% coverage in your code. We want you to tell us how you faced the challenge,
the problems you had to solve and how far you could go. We are interested in knowing your way of thinking more than your speed to implement the solution.

## About the app.
Build a song search engine using the iTunes API (e.g.: https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=in+utero&mediaType=music&limit=20) that have the following features:

• Show results with pagination (20 items per page).

• Select an item from the search and show the album to which it belongs including:
  ◦ Arte de 100x100.
  ◦ Album name.
  ◦ Band name.
  ◦ Song list.
  
• For the album, be able to consume and visualize the progress in the preview of the songs.

• Store the searches carried out locally and offer to repeat them in case of not having an internet connection.

• Handle 500 errors, "term not found", INET_CONN_ERROR.

• Use animations and transitions between views.
